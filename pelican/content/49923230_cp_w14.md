Reviews of using Onshape and collaboration
--------------------------------------

Onshape is a fantastic browser app for CAD 3D design. People can collaborate with team on the smae working page. If there is something goes wrong, the histroy function might be helpful for designer. And the interface is really simple to use, just like solidworks. I think it's going to be very populer because of its convenience and collaboration function. Especially people don't need to bring their heavy laptop anymore. Becauese it supports tablets and smartphones, which makes people and work or show the design wherever they want.
