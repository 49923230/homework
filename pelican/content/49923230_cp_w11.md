Reviews of using Creo and Github with team
--------------------------------------
Actually, I think it's very convinient that github can help us to save all the history which have pushed up to the github page. But since Onshape has been on the market recently. There is the other way can collaborate with the team. But still, github is not only for CAD design. It's for programming designer who can writing the program by collaboration. So I think github is still irreplaceable.
