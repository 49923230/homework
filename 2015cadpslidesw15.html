    <p>It's really cool that professor taught us not only CAD, but also a lot of value system and growing trend of technology of the world. I didn't know anything about github before, cuz I didn't have that much interested in programming. But I realize that it's also a trend in the world. It's almost becoming a basic knowledge for every single person. It's a awsome couse I can ever have. And also professor always mention about how important of english skill. So that's why I tried to do most of the assignments in english instead of chinese. In the future, we will face all the competitor from all over the world. And english will be the basic skill for us to compete with them. </p>
